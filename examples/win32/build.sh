#
# Three things have to be told to `mojo build` on this machine, and each is a
# Windows-specific trap worth naming:
#
#   * MODULAR_MOJO_MAX_IMPORT_PATH -- use the stdlib we just built, not an
#     installed one. There isn't an installed one; this is the port.
#
#   * MODULAR_MOJO_MAX_COMPILERRT_PATH -- points at the .dll; mojo-build
#     substitutes the .lib sibling for the link line (see PORT-JOURNAL).
#
#   * PATH -- Git Bash ships its own coreutils `link.exe` in /usr/bin, which
#     wins findProgramByName("link.exe") and then rejects MSVC's `/X` style
#     flags with "link: unknown option -- X". The MSVC linker has to come
#     first. Same story for clang.
#
#   * LIB -- the linker resolves msvcrt/ucrt/kernel32 through the LIB
#     environment variable, and Bazel's hermetic sysroot is not on it. We
#     point at the same sysroot the toolchain uses rather than whatever a
#     Developer Command Prompt would have set, so an example links against
#     exactly what the compiler was built against.
#
# --target-cpu generic is also deliberate: the default neoverse-n1 scheduling
# model is incomplete for some of the load/store pair instructions the backend
# emits here, and an assertions-enabled LLVM aborts on it (TargetSchedule.cpp
# "incomplete machine model"). Snapdragon X is Oryon, not an N1, so the proxy
# was never right anyway.
