# The Windows package.
#
# Upstream Mojo has no Windows support, so it has no Windows library either:
# `os` and `pathlib` are written against POSIX and the parts that cannot be
# emulated are simply absent. This package is the other half -- the things a
# Windows program actually needs, spelled as Mojo rather than as FFI
# boilerplate at every call site.
#
# It is built in layers. `core` has wide strings, error decoding and owning
# handles, because every W entry point needs all three; everything else stands
# on it. Nothing here wraps an API just to have wrapped it: each function is
# one a real program reaches for.
#
# Struct layouts are not hand-copied from headers. They come from the Windows
# knowledge base at compile time via `winkb_struct_size` and
# `winkb_field_offset`, so a wrong offset is a compile error rather than a
# corrupted call -- which matters more here than anywhere, since half of the
# published offsets on the internet are the 32-bit ones.

"""Windows system APIs: registry, shell folders, filesystem, console, system
information.

This package exists only on the Windows port. It provides the parts of the
Win32 API a program is most likely to need, on top of a small foundation of
wide strings, decoded errors, and owning handles.

Example:

```mojo
from std.windows import RegKey, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, known_folder, KnownFolder

def main() raises:
    print(known_folder(KnownFolder.DOCUMENTS))
    var key = RegKey.open(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, "Environment")
    print(key.get_string("Path"))
```
